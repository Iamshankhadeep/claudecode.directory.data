## Context Analysis

Before providing recommendations, analyze these key aspects:

1. **Business Domain Complexity**
   - Identify core business capabilities and bounded contexts
   - Map domain relationships and dependencies
   - Assess organizational structure (Conway's Law implications)
   - Evaluate regulatory and compliance requirements

2. **Technical Landscape**
   - Current system architecture and technology stack
   - Data consistency and transaction requirements
   - Performance and scalability requirements
   - Security and compliance constraints
   - Team expertise and organizational maturity

3. **Operational Constraints**
   - Deployment and infrastructure capabilities
   - Monitoring and observability requirements
   - Disaster recovery and business continuity needs
   - Budget and resource limitations

## Microservices Design Framework

### 1. Domain Decomposition Strategy

Provide a systematic approach to breaking down the monolith:

**Bounded Context Identification:**
- Apply Domain-Driven Design principles
- Identify aggregate boundaries
- Map business capabilities to services
- Define service ownership and team boundaries

**Service Sizing Guidelines:**
- Single Responsibility Principle application
- Database-per-service considerations
- Team cognitive load assessment
- Independent deployability requirements

**Example Output:**
\`\`\`
Core Services Identified:
1. User Management Service
   - Bounded Context: Identity & Access
   - Aggregates: User, Role, Permission
   - Team: Platform Team
   - Data: User profiles, authentication data

2. Order Processing Service
   - Bounded Context: Order Management
   - Aggregates: Order, OrderItem, PaymentInfo
   - Team: Commerce Team
   - Data: Orders, payment transactions

3. Inventory Service
   - Bounded Context: Product Catalog & Inventory
   - Aggregates: Product, Inventory, Category
   - Team: Product Team
   - Data: Product catalog, stock levels
\`\`\`

### 2. Service Communication Patterns

Design comprehensive communication strategies:

**Synchronous Communication:**
- RESTful API design with proper versioning
- GraphQL federation for complex queries
- gRPC for high-performance internal communication
- Circuit breaker and retry mechanisms

**Asynchronous Communication:**
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Message broker selection (Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS)
- Event sourcing and CQRS implementation
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

**Example Architecture:**
\`\`\`typescript
// Event-driven communication example
interface OrderCreatedEvent {
  eventId: string;
  timestamp: string;
  aggregateId: string;
  version: number;
  payload: {
    orderId: string;
    customerId: string;
    items: OrderItem[];
    totalAmount: number;
  };
}

// Saga orchestration for order processing
class OrderProcessingSaga {
  async handle(event: OrderCreatedEvent) {
    try {
      await this.reserveInventory(event.payload);
      await this.processPayment(event.payload);
      await this.createShipment(event.payload);
      await this.sendOrderConfirmation(event.payload);
    } catch (error) {
      await this.compensate(event, error);
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Data Management Strategy

Address distributed data challenges:

**Database Design:**
- Database-per-service implementation
- Polyglot persistence considerations
- Data consistency patterns (eventual consistency vs strong consistency)
- Cross-service data synchronization

**Data Patterns:**
- Event Sourcing for audit trails
- CQRS for read/write separation
- Materialized views for complex queries
- Data lake/warehouse integration

### 4. Service Mesh Architecture

Design advanced networking and security:

**Service Mesh Selection:**
- Istio vs Linkerd vs Consul Connect comparison
- Performance and resource overhead analysis
- Feature requirements (security, observability, traffic management)

**Traffic Management:**
- Load balancing strategies
- Circuit breaking and fault tolerance
- Blue-green and canary deployments
- A/B testing infrastructure

**Security Implementation:**
- mTLS for service-to-service communication
- Identity and access management integration
- Policy enforcement (authorization, rate limiting)
- Certificate lifecycle management

### 5. Observability and Monitoring

Implement comprehensive monitoring:

**Distributed Tracing:**
- OpenTelemetry implementation across services
- Trace correlation and context propagation
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error tracking and root cause analysis

**Metrics and Alerting:**
- Business metrics vs technical metrics
- SLI/SLO definition for each service
- Alerting strategies and escalation procedures
- Cost monitoring and optimization

**Logging Strategy:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Centralized log aggregation (ELK, Fluentd)
- Log retention and compliance policies
- Real-time log analysis and alerting

### 6. Deployment and DevOps Strategy

Design CI/CD for microservices:

**Deployment Patterns:**
- Independent service deployments
- Database migration strategies
- Rollback procedures and data consistency
- Blue-green deployment implementation

**Container Orchestration:**
- Kubernetes deployment strategies
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Auto-scaling and resource management
- Multi-environment promotion pipeline

## Architecture Decision Template

For each major decision, provide this structured analysis:

**Context:**
- Current business requirements
- Technical constraints
- Team structure and capabilities

**Options Considered:**

## Implementation Roadmap

Provide a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Service identification and boundary definition
- Core infrastructure setup (service mesh, monitoring)
- First 2-3 services extraction
- Development team training

### Phase 2: Core Services (Months 4-6)
- Extract remaining critical services
- Implement inter-service communication
- Establish CI/CD pipelines
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 7-9)
- Advanced patterns (CQRS, Event Sourcing)
- Security hardening
- Disaster recovery implementation
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Optimization (Months 10-12)

- Chaos engineering implementation
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Highlight common pitfalls:

1. **Distributed Monolith**: Services too tightly coupled
2. **Chatty Interfaces**: Excessive inter-service communication
3. **Shared Database**: Multiple services accessing same database
4. **Synchronous Everything**: Over-reliance on synchronous communication
5. **Premature Optimization**: Complex patterns before necessary

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Identify and address key risks:

**Technical Risks:**
- Network latency and reliability
- Data consistency challenges
- Operational complexity
- Security vulnerabilities

**Organizational Risks:**
- Team coordination overhead
- Skill gap and learning curve

- Deployment complexity

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive testing strategies
- Gradual migration approach
- Team training and skill development
- Automation and tooling investment

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**
- Service availability (99.9% uptime)
- Response time improvements (< 200ms p95)
- Deployment frequency (multiple times per day)
- Mean time to recovery (< 1 hour)

**Business Metrics:**
- Feature delivery velocity
- Time to market for new features
- System scalability and performance
- Operational cost efficiency
